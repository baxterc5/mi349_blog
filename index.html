                <h3>Rome, Italy: No More Aperol Propaganda!</h3>

                <p>When I was researching the must-try experiences for my study abroad trip to Rome, one thing kept popping up on every travel blog and influencer's list: the Aperol Spritz. Apparently, this was the drink to order while on an Italian getaway. So, on our very first night, as my roommates and I sat down at a little restaurant near our apartment, we knew what to do. Without hesitation, we all agreed—how could we be in Italy and not order an Aperol Spritz?</p>
                <p>Our waiter, Christian, who would soon become a familiar face, brought us our drinks, and we were all restless with excitement. Both from actually being in Rome and from ordering this iconic drink. We took pictures, recorded a video of us clinking glasses, and then finally took our first sips—all at the same time. Instantly, everyone’s faces dropped. Never have I seen a whole group of girls' expressions all fall so fast. It was genuinely awful. We exchanged looks, wondering if we'd somehow ordered the wrong thing, but nope—this was definitely the right drink. A second sip only confirmed it: we'd been misled by the influencers and their aesthetics. Despite our disappointment, we powered through and finished our drinks, but that was both the first and last Aperol Spritz any of us ordered during our nearly two-month stay.</p>
                <p>After spending that time in Italy, I can confidently make my own recommendation now. Feeling so local. The drink I fell in love with—and ordered every chance I got—was the Hugo Spritz. With St-Germain and prosecco, it was so much smoother and more enjoyable than Aperol could ever hope to be. When meeting up with the girls a couple times a year for a mini reunion, you can trust that every time we bring the ingredients needed to make our own, constantly missing the drink that got us through. So, I think it’s about time that we ended the Aperol propaganda and gave the true queen her crown, Miss Hugo.</p>

                <h3>Paris, France: The Eiffel Tower - Act Like It's New York</h3>
                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Chloé Baxter</p>
                <time datetime="2024-10-13">October 13, 2024</time>
                <img src="/images/eiffel.jpg" alt="Eiffel Tower" >
                
                <p>The Eiffel Tower is probably the first landmark everyone learns about. I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t recognize it. Even my 4-year-old niece knows what it is, and does she know the Statue of Liberty? The Great Wall of China? Nope. Neither.</p>
                <p>As someone who has always wanted to travel overseas, it’s only natural that seeing the Eiffel Tower was on my bucket list. It’s one of those things you see and you get that feeling like ‘I actually made it here and this place is a real place, that exists every day.’ Don’t get me wrong, when I first spotted it, I felt exactly that. I couldn’t believe I’d gotten to see it so young. But, the reality sets in a little more the closer you get to it.</p>
                <p>I was having a beautiful time. I stopped in some corner bakery and got one of my favorite desserts, raspberry macarons. I took them along with me and my friend Brandon to go eat them on the lawn in front of the tower. We sat a little ways back, just far enough to relax and enjoy our food in peace before deciding to move closer for a better view.</p>
                <p>It was almost as if there is this invisible line that once you cross, every single person in a mile radius that is trying to sell you something can sense your aura. They can smell your fear and the money that you have in your wallet. Suddenly, we were being swarmed, shouted at, and pressured by people trying to sell us things no one would ever want. A light-up, 4-inch Eiffel Tower replica? A 15-euro magnet? Or the guy tossing a light-up ball in front of us, trying to distract us while another vendor eyed our bags. It was overwhelming.</p>
                <p>After we got away from all of them, unscathed but annoyed, we made a pact. The next time we visited the Eiffel Tower, we’d pretend we were in New York City. No romanticizing our surroundings. No getting caught up in the magic of Paris. Instead, we’d act like seasoned New Yorkers: don’t make eye contact, don’t respond, don’t care, don’t even apologize. Just keep your bag in front of you and move on. With that mindset, none of the street hustlers could phase us. All it took was pretending we were looking at the Empire State instead of the Eiffel Tower.</p>
